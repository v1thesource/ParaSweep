# ParaSweep
A generalised tool for sensitivity analysis of defect equilibria

The tool goes through a series of steps to conduct a sensitivity analysis for a desired parameter:
  - A datafile of the defect equilibria data at each parameter increment is populated
  - The datafile is parsed and a plot of the defect equilibria at each increment is generated
  - The individual plots are stitched together to create a visualisation of a parameter sweep (ParaSweep!)
